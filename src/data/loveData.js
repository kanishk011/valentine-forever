// LOVE LETTER - From Kanishk to Raghavi
// ============================================
export const loveLetter = `My Dearest Raghavi,

There are moments in life that words fail to capture, feelings so profound that language feels inadequate. Yet here I am, trying to pour my heart onto this page, hoping these words find their way to your beautiful soul.

From the very first moment I met you on June 11, 2020, something shifted inside me. It wasn't just attraction—it was recognition. Like my soul had been waiting for yours all along, and finally, finally, you arrived.

Every day with you is a gift I never knew I needed. You've taught me that love isn't just a feeling—it's a choice we make every single day. And I choose you, Raghavi. I'll always choose you.

You are my first thought in the morning and my last wish at night. You are the calm in my chaos, the light in my darkness, the home I never knew I was searching for.

I love the way you laugh. I love how you care so deeply. I love your strength, your kindness, your beautiful heart. I love everything about you, Raghavi.

This website, these words, this digital love letter—it's my way of saying what I sometimes struggle to express. It's my heart, coded into existence, built with late nights and endless love for you.

You deserve all the happiness in the universe, and I want to spend every moment of my life trying to give it to you.

Forever yours,
Kanishk`;
